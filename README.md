# Vast-Food
Design concept which views burger king, wendys, mcdonalds as target, k mart, kohls and stomps upon them with Central/Amazonization. 

Also sprung about by a: ../ Data Question (below) asked chatGPT & google for mcDs, wendys, BK no clear answer 

just heard as anyone has a million times on commercials:
"at participating locations only. prices may vary"

When they say at participating locations only... is there data on how many mcdonalds locations 
participate in those offers?
I'd say a pretty high amount like 65-80% participate in those deals?

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
not startup idea just thinking, hopefully stretch reflex of sneaking wordplay in code app titles. 
would be cool API project if one could get those data or mak mock data for charting/dat-vis
`<npm rechart/> | <npm i chart.js/>`

// sidenote: 
UberEats (& friends & enemies) does this w/o public repo?
